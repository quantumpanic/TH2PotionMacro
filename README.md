ABOUT THIS MACRO
- A tool to help quick drink potions without using default number keys.
- Can save a maximum of 3 types of potions. Use keys 1-3 corresponding to each saved potion.
- Also has a feature to quick drag potions in inventory to belt.
- Default number of potions to grab from inventory is 4. (Change this using PotionsToTake below.)
- Currently only works for 1920x1080 resolution, but feel free to test out other resolution.
- Desktop resolution MUST be the same as game resolution, or the color mapping won't work.
- Should work on relics and runes as well. (Needs testing.)\n

HOW TO USE
1. Use Alt + Shift + Q on your first belt slot AND the bottom left-most inventory slot. (Both required!)
2. To register a potion type, you will need AT LEAST 2 of the same type.
3. Different tiers don't count (example: healing potion is NOT the same as full healing).
4. Put one potion in the belt slot #1, and the other in the bottom left inventory.
5. Then use Alt + Shift + 1/2/3 to map the color codes for your potion of choice.
6. Hotkey to quick drink potion: 1/2/3
7. Hotkey to quick grab potion from inventory: Alt + 1/2/3
